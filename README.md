# Single-Layer-Neural-Network

This project implements a single layer neural network also calles "perceptron". 
The data source could be any random data set or come from a logic gate such as AND, OR, NAND, etc.
A 10-fold cross validation technique is used to test the accuracy of the developed algorithm.
